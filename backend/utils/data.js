    description:
      "No spacecraft has gone farther than NASA's Voyager 1 launched on September 5, 1977. Its so far away that it takes light 20 hours and 33 minutes to travel meaning means it takes roughly two days to send a message to Voyager 1.",

      "Footprints left on the Moon won't disappear as there is no wind. Unlike on Earth, there is no erosion by wind or water on the Moon because it has no atmosphere and all the water on the surface is frozen as ice.",
